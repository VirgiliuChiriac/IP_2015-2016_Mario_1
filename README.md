I recommend you to open this project with Code::Blocks, because it was conceived on this platform and there are highly chances for it to work properly on your machine by doing so. If you want to open it with Visual Studio, don't forget to add this library at the beginning of the project: #include "stdafx.h"

This is my work. I invested a lot of energy, time, and thoughts in it so respect it, and try to learn as much as you can from it.
